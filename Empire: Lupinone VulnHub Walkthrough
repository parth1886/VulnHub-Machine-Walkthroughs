# Empire: Lupinone VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
Empire: Lupinone is an intermediate-level VulnHub machine designed to challenge users with enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation tasks. This walkthrough provides detailed steps to own the machine and capture the root flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Perform network discovery to identify the target IP.  
- Scan for open ports and running services using `nmap`.  

### 2. **Service Enumeration**  
- Explore discovered services for vulnerabilities.  
- Use tools like `gobuster` to enumerate hidden directories on web servers.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Leverage discovered vulnerabilities to gain initial access.  
- Analyze the system to identify paths for privilege escalation.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system for SUID binaries, misconfigurations, or other exploitable vectors.  
- Exploit these vulnerabilities to gain root access.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Navigate to the `/root` directory to find and read the flag file.
