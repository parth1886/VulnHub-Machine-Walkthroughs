# DC-1 VulnHub Walkthrough   

## Description  
DC-1 is a beginner-friendly VulnHub machine designed to help users practice penetration testing techniques such as enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This walkthrough provides a step-by-step guide to owning the machine and capturing the root flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Beginner  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Scan the network and identify open ports using `nmap`.  
- Analyze running services and potential attack vectors.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (Port 80)**  
- Inspect the website for hidden directories using tools like `gobuster`.  
- Access files like `robots.txt` or backup files to extract sensitive information.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Use the extracted credentials to access the system through SSH.  
- Explore the target to identify possible privilege escalation paths.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system for SUID binaries or misconfigurations.  
- Exploit vulnerabilities to gain root access.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Locate and read the flag file in the `/root` directory.
