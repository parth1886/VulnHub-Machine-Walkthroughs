# HackathonCTF: 1 VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
HackathonCTF: 1 is an intermediate-level machine on VulnHub, designed to test skills in enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This walkthrough provides a step-by-step guide to rooting the machine and capturing the flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.101`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Perform a network scan to identify the target IP and open ports.  

### 2. **Service Enumeration**  
- Analyze services running on open ports to find potential entry points.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Leverage discovered vulnerabilities to gain initial access.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system for misconfigurations or vulnerable binaries.  
- Exploit identified vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to root.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Navigate to the root directory and retrieve the flag.

## Tools Used  
- `nmap` â€“ For port scanning and service discovery.  
- `gobuster` â€“ To identify hidden directories.  
- `exploit-db` â€“ For finding and using public exploits.  
- `ssh` â€“ To access the target system remotely.
