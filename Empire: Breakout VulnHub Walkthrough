# Empire: Breakout VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
Empire: Breakout is an intermediate-level VulnHub machine designed to challenge and enhance your penetration testing skills. This walkthrough provides a comprehensive guide to enumerating, exploiting, and gaining root access to the machine.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Identified during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.105`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use `netdiscover` to locate the target machine.  
- Perform an `nmap` scan to identify open ports and services.  

### 2. **Service Enumeration**  
- Analyze discovered services for vulnerabilities.  
- Focus on services running on high-risk ports.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Identify and exploit weaknesses in the target system.  
- Use proper tools and scripts to gain initial access.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Search for misconfigurations, SUID binaries, or vulnerable software.  
- Escalate privileges to root using a suitable exploit.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Locate the flag file, typically in the `/root` directory, and read its content.
