# MrRobot:1 VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
MrRobot:1 is a VulnHub machine inspired by the popular TV series *Mr. Robot*. This machine challenges users with realistic scenarios, requiring skills in enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation to gain root access and capture the flags.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)  
- **Objective:** Find and capture all three flags.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use `nmap` to identify open ports and services.  
- Analyze the results to determine the next steps for exploitation.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (Port 80)**  
- Explore the website for hidden directories or files.  
- Use tools like `gobuster` to brute-force directories and identify useful resources.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Analyze exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.  
- Utilize vulnerabilities to gain initial foothold access.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system for potential weaknesses.  
- Exploit privilege escalation vectors to gain root access.  

### 5. **Capture the Flags**  
- Locate and read the flags hidden across the system.

## Tools Used  
- `nmap` – For port scanning and service enumeration.  
- `gobuster` – For directory brute-forcing.  
- `wget` – To download files from the target.  
- `ssh` – For remote access.  
- `strings` – To analyze binaries.  
- Other standard penetration testing tools.
