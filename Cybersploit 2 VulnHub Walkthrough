# Cybersploit 2 VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
Cybersploit 2 is an intermediate-level VulnHub machine designed to challenge penetration testers with enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation tasks. This walkthrough provides step-by-step guidance to own the machine and capture the root flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.105`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  
- **Video Walkthrough:** Watch the detailed walkthrough on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4Bum2c6yyho) by **Parth Virani**.

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use `netdiscover` to identify the target IP.  
- Perform a detailed scan with `nmap` to find open ports and running services.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (Port 80)**  
- Analyze the website using tools like `gobuster` or `dirb`.  
- Identify hidden directories or files that may contain useful information.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Exploit discovered vulnerabilities in web applications, services, or configurations.  
- Gain initial access to the system through identified weaknesses.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system to find misconfigured files, SUID binaries, or kernel exploits.  
- Leverage these findings to escalate privileges and gain root access.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Navigate to `/root` and read the `flag.txt` file to complete the machine.
