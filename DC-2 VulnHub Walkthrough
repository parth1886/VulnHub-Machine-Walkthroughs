# DC-2 VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
DC-2 is a beginner-to-intermediate level VulnHub machine that challenges users to improve their penetration testing skills. This walkthrough provides a step-by-step guide to exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining root access, and capturing the final flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.101`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use tools like `netdiscover` or `arp-scan` to find the target IP address.  
- Perform a comprehensive port scan using `nmap` to identify open services.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (Port 80)**  
- Analyze the website for potential entry points, hidden directories, or vulnerabilities.  
- Use tools like `gobuster` or `dirsearch` to discover hidden paths.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the discovered services or web applications.  
- Use the extracted credentials or information to gain initial access.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the system to find privilege escalation paths, such as SUID binaries or configuration issues.  
- Exploit the identified weaknesses to gain root privileges.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Navigate to the `/root` directory to locate and read the flag file.

## Tools Used  
- `netdiscover` – Network discovery tool.  
- `nmap` – Port scanning and service enumeration.  
- `gobuster` – Hidden directory brute-forcing.  
- `wget` – Downloading files from the target.  
- `ssh` – Remote access to the target machine.  
- `linpeas` – Automated privilege escalation script.
