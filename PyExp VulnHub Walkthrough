## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.105`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough Steps  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use `netdiscover` or a similar tool to identify the target IP.  
- Perform a detailed scan with `nmap` to find open ports and services.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration**  
- Analyze the website hosted on the target.  
- Use tools like `gobuster` to enumerate hidden directories.  

### 3. **Code and Script Analysis**  
- Explore Python scripts on the target system.  
- Identify vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the target for potential privilege escalation paths, such as vulnerable binaries or misconfigured services.  
- Exploit a discovered vulnerability to gain root access.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Locate the flag file (usually in `/root`) and read its contents.

## Tools Used  
- `netdiscover` – Identify the target IP.  
- `nmap` – Port scanning and service enumeration.  
- `gobuster` – Directory enumeration.  
- `python` – Script analysis and exploitation.
