## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Use `nmap` to scan for open ports and services.  
- Perform a detailed scan to identify potential vulnerabilities.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (Port 80)**  
- Inspect the website hosted on the target.  
- Use tools like `gobuster` to discover hidden directories and files.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Exploit vulnerabilities in the web application or services to gain initial access.  
- Utilize the extracted information to escalate privileges.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the target system for misconfigured binaries or services.  
- Exploit the system to gain root privileges.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Locate and read the flag file in the `/root` directory.
