# Katana VulnHub Walkthrough  

## Description  
Katana is an intermediate-level VulnHub machine designed to test your penetration testing skills. This walkthrough provides a detailed step-by-step guide to exploiting vulnerabilities, achieving root access, and capturing the flag.  

---

## Key Information  
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate  
- **Target IP:** Discovered during enumeration (e.g., `192.168.1.101`)  
- **Objective:** Gain root access and capture the flag.  

---

## Walkthrough  

### 1. **Network Enumeration**  
- Perform a network scan using `nmap` to identify open ports and services.  
- Analyze service versions for potential vulnerabilities.  

### 2. **Web Enumeration (if applicable)**  
- Use tools like `gobuster` or `dirsearch` to discover hidden directories.  
- Analyze web application behavior and source code for exploitable vulnerabilities.  

### 3. **Exploitation**  
- Exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain initial access to the target system.  
- Extract sensitive information or escalate privileges using available techniques.  

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**  
- Enumerate the target system to identify misconfigurations or exploitable binaries.  
- Gain root access by leveraging discovered vulnerabilities.  

### 5. **Capture the Flag**  
- Navigate to the `/root` directory and read the flag file.  

---

## Tools Used  
- `nmap` – For port scanning and service enumeration.  
- `gobuster` – To discover hidden directories.  
- `ssh` – To access the target remotely.  
- `linpeas` – To enumerate potential privilege escalation paths.
